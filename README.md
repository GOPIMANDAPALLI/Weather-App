# Weather-App


*DESCRIPTION* :

The provided Python program is a graphical weather application built using the tkinter module. It fetches and displays current weather information for selected cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The user interface is created with various tkinter widgets such as Label, Button, and ttk.Combobox. Users can select a city from a predefined dropdown list containing names of major cities from India and around the world. Upon clicking the "DONE" button, the program retrieves live weather data using the requests module and the user's API key (imported from a separate key.py file). The weather data includes the country code, climate condition, detailed weather description, temperature in Celsius, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. These values are dynamically displayed in corresponding labels on the app window. The application's window is styled with a pink background and clear font choices to ensure readability, and the layout is arranged using the place geometry manager for precise control of widget positioning. Overall, the program provides a user-friendly way to access real-time weather information for a wide range of global cities.
